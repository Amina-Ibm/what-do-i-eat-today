Name: One-Pot Chicken Fajita Pasta
Description: This simple recipe combines chicken fajitas and pasta in one delicious dish made in just one pot. It boasts a blend of Tex-Mex flavors in a comforting dish that we'd enjoy any day of the week — or weekend! Start by searing sliced chicken in a pot until golden, then sauté bell peppers and onions until caramelized. Season generously with garlic, cumin, and chili powder, and let the flavors meld. Add milk and penne to the pot; let the pasta soak up the rich spices as it simmers to tender perfection, and the sauce thickens into a creamy coating that clings to each pasta tube. Stir in pepper Jack cheese for a flavorful dish that seriously satisfies the soul!
