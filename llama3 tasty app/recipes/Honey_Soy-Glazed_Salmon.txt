Name: Honey Soy-Glazed Salmon
Description: Who knew honey and salmon were such a delicious pair? The results of this recipe are irresistible, and we're pretty sure it'll become your go-to weeknight dinner. A delightful blend of honey, soy sauce, garlic, and ginger coats the salmon, infusing it with deliciousness in just 30 minutes. Sizzle the salmon in a hot pan until it crisps up perfectly on the outside. Then, take the leftover marinade, heat it, and let it thicken into a heavenly glaze for drizzling over the fish. Pair it with your preferred veggies (we like broccoli!) or rice for a complete meal that's hard to beat.
