Instruction 1: In a large bowl, combine the ground beef, breadcrumbs, onion, egg, ½ tablespoon salt, and ½ tablespoon pepper, mixing until evenly combined.
Instruction 2: Heat the canola oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Take about a golf-ball size of the meatball mixture and roll it into balls. Place the meatballs into the pot, cooking for one minute. Flip the meatballs.
Instruction 3: Add the beef broth, milk, remaining ½ tablespoon salt, remaining ½ tablespoon pepper, and Worcestershire sauce and give it a stir.
Instruction 4: Bring the liquid to a boil, then add the egg noodles. Stir constantly until the pasta is cooked and the liquid has reduced to a sauce that coats the noodles, about seven to eight minutes.
Instruction 5: Add the parmesan and the parsley, stirring until the cheese is melted.
Instruction 6: Enjoy!
