Instruction 1: Preheat oven to 400˚F (200˚C).
Instruction 2: Season the chicken breasts with paprika, salt, and pepper. Place in a shallow dish and add 2 tablespoons of the oil, 1 teaspoon of the mustard, the garlic, and half the lemon zest.
Instruction 3: Toss until the chicken breasts are fully coated, then cover the dish and marinate at least 30 minutes, up to overnight.
Instruction 4: On a baking sheet, toss the potato halves with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Season with salt and pepper and roast until tender and golden, 25 to 30 minutes.
Instruction 5: Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Remove the chicken breasts from the marinade, and working in two batches, cook until golden brown on one side, 6 to 8 minutes. Flip each breast and continue to cook until the chicken is cooked through, 2 to 4 minutes longer. Transfer to a serving platter and repeat with the remaining oil and breasts.
Instruction 6: In a small bowl, stir together the yogurt with the remaining 1 teaspoon mustard, lemon zest, salt, pepper and the parsley.
Instruction 7: Serve the chicken with the yogurt and potato wedges.
Instruction 8: Enjoy!
