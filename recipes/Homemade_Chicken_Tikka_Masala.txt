Name: Homemade Chicken Tikka Masala
Description: Are you tired of the same old bland dinners? Give this chicken tikka masala a try. Originating from the Indian subcontinent, this dish is known for its rich flavor and comforting appeal. Bite-sized chicken pieces are marinated in a mixture of yogurt, cumin, paprika, and garam masala to tenderize and flavor the meat. Once marinated, the chicken is baked in the oven, then simmered in a rich, creamy tomato-based sauce infused with aromatic spices. The tanginess of the tomatoes balances the richness of the cream and the boldness of the spices, infusing every mouthful with depth. Pair with fluffy steamed rice or buttery garlic naan for the most flavorful dinner ever!

Prep Time Minutes: 20
Yields: Servings: 5-6
Instruction 1: Slice the chicken into bite-sized chunks. Combine the cubed chicken with the yogurt, lemon juice, garlic, ginger, salt, cumin, garam masala, and paprika and stir until well-coated.
Instruction 2: Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or overnight.
Instruction 3: Preheat the oven to 500°F (260°C). Line a high-sided baking pan or roasting tray with parchment paper.
Instruction 4: Place the marinated chicken pieces on bamboo or wooden skewers, then set them over the prepared baking pan, making sure there is space underneath the chicken to help distribute the heat more evenly. Bake for about 15 minutes, until slightly dark brown on the edges.
Instruction 5: Make the sauce: Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat, then sauté the onions, ginger, and garlic until tender but not browned. Add the cumin, turmeric, coriander, paprika, chili powder, and garam masala and stir constantly for about 30 seconds, until the spices are fragrant. Stir in the tomato puree, tomato sauce, and 1 ¼ cups of water, then bring to a boil and cook for about 5 minutes. Pour in the cream.
Instruction 6: Remove the chicken from the skewers and add to the sauce, cooking for another 1-2 minutes. Garnish with cilantro and serve over rice or alongside naan bread.
Instruction 7: Enjoy!
