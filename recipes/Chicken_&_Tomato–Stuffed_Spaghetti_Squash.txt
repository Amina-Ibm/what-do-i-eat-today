Instruction 1: Preheat oven to 375˚F (190˚C).
Instruction 2: With a sharp knife, slice the squash in half. (If the squash is too tough - puncture in several places forming a dotted line around the squash. Microwave 3-5 minutes to soften. Allow to cool before cutting in half - following the dotted line).
Instruction 3: Scoop out the seeds, brush with oil, salt, and pepper, and place face down on a baking tray. Bake for 35-40 minutes or until a fork can easily pierce the skin.
Instruction 4: Heat olive oil in a large pan. Add chicken breasts (seasoned with salt and pepper) and garlic, and fully cook.
Instruction 5: Add tomatoes and spinach. Cook until spinach has wilted. Add marinara sauce.
Instruction 6: Stack the basil leaves and roll them up. Cut into slices and add to pan.
Instruction 7: Add crushed red pepper, and stir until the ingredients are fully incorporated.
Instruction 8: Once the squash has finished roasting, remove from the oven and let it sit for a few minutes before turning over and pulling at it with a fork. (Careful, there will be some steam!)
Instruction 9: Shred the inside of each squash, being careful not to poke through the skin. Pour the sauce over the shredded squash, top with fresh basil, and serve.
Instruction 10: Enjoy!
